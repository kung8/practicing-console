    <h3>Quick Bio: I'm from Alabama. I sat on a bus ride to a soccer game, and felt sick from somebody's homemade fish jerky.</h3>
    <p>I love magic! Next time you see me, ask me to show you my latest magic trick!</p>
    <p>I also really love Chocolate Chip Cookies. That is my weakness. 'If I were to die eating one thing, it'd be Chocolate Chip Cookies.'</p>
